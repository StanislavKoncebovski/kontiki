# The *kontiki* Project

The project's goal is to provide client API's to operate with Library Genesis (libgen) server.

## Motivation
Our team has started a project to be an alternative replacement for the Zotero bibliography management system. 
Communication with the LibGen server is a central part of the whole future application.
Existing approaches we have been able to find did not seem to be productive, therefore this project.

## Implementation
The API is going to be in two modifications: in Python and in C#.
